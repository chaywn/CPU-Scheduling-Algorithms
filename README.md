## Compile and Run Instructions
To compile and run the application, ensure that [Java JDK is installed with JavaFx](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk-fx). 

Below are the instructions for compiling and running the program:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal window and **cd** to the project folder (```../CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms```).

2. Run the following command to compile all .java files in the project folder:  
  ```javac *.java```

3. In the same directory, run the following command to start the program:  
  ```java Main```

4. Optionally, run the [CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms](/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms.jar) **JAR file** in the project folder to instantly start the program.
